**For if each Star is little more a mathematical Point,**

**located upon the Hemisphere of Heaven by Right Ascension and Declination,**

**then all the Stars, taken together, tho' innumerable,**

**must like any other set of points,**

**in turn represent some single gigantick Equation,**

**to the mind of God as straightforward as, say, the Equation of a Sphere,**

**---to us unreadable, incalculable.**

**A lonely, uncompensated, perhaps even impossible Task,**

**---yet some of us must ever be seeking, I suppose.**
